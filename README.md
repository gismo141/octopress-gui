Octopress GUI
=============

This project aim to bring the octopress blogging framework to everybody. Octopress is a command line tool but it's a wonderful blogging plaform and it should'nt be restricted to CLI users. That is why i'm creating a GUI on top of it.

I aim to bring a most beautiful and native look and feel as possible. This is why I'll be using the Qt framework. Using Qt, the app can be used equally on iOS, Android, Windows, Linux and OS X without the hassle of programming every design individually. Therefor the main programming language will be C++.
